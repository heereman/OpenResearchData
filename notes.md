##Aim of Open Research Data workshops
- Understand the value of research data curation
- Educate good routines in Research Data Management
- Help researchers find their way in how to shar and archive their data

##Define what we mean by:
- Research Data
- Sharing Research Data

##Why Good Research Data Management and Sharing Research Data
- [Advertisement video from DCC on Managing Research Data and why to do this](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/news/managing-research-data-video)

##Data Life Cycle 
e.g. this simple graphical expression [from Lancaster University](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/library/rdm/what-is-rdm/plan/data-lifecycle/)

##Half Day workshop on creating Data Management Plans
- What is a Research Data Management Plan and why should I make one
- How to create proper data management plans
- Which tools to use to generate online Data Management Plans. Examples, [DMPonline tool](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) from the DCC and the [DMPTool](https://dmp.cdlib.org/) from the University of California

##Half Day workshop on good Data Management?
Why is it necessary to manage your data properly? What should you think about when working with research data
- Data Structure (Example from this [Computational Biology paper](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424))
- Folder/file naming ([Stanford University Libraries](https://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/data-best-practices/best-practices-file-naming), [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/records-management/records-management/staff-guidance/electronic-records/naming-conventions)
- Metadata and documentation ([Disciplinary metadata standards](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/drupal/resources/metadata-standards), [Metadata and documentation UCD Library)](http://libguides.ucd.ie/data/doc_metadata))
- File formats ([Stanford University Libraries](https://library.stanford.edu/research/data-management-services/data-best-practices/best-practices-file-formats), [University of Oregon](https://library.uoregon.edu/datamanagement/fileformats.html))
- Version Control. What should be under Version Control and what not. Learning version control follow SWC courses

##Half Day workshop on Archiving Data
- The archived data set should be useful for others to use. How to make a data set valid for archiving using the [FAIR principles](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples)
- Which archives to use (http://www.re3data.org/ https://archive.norstore.no/ https://www.eudat.eu/)

##Licensing Research Data 
- Sharing data should be credited and not due for misuse. By licensing the data these requirements can be acieved. The [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org) have different license types that accomodates for different types of data. There is also a [norwegian site](https://creativecommons.no) for the Creative Commons licenses.
